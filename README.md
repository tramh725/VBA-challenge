# VBA-challenge

This week, I was taught how to manipulate the columns, finding, and filtering the datas that was provided. This assignment proved to be a great task, considering how I looked back on class videos as well as received help from the Student Center. With a student aid's help, she explained the 'begin=1+i' code, so when I run the script, it came back with the result that I wanted.
